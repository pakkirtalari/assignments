    "Q1. What is Random Forest Regressor?\n",
    "\n",
    "A1. Random Forest Regressor is a machine learning algorithm that belongs to the ensemble learning family, specifically the Random Forest ensemble. It is used for regression tasks, where the goal is to predict a continuous numeric output based on input features. It works by creating an ensemble of multiple decision trees, each trained on different subsets of the data, and then combining their predictions to make a final prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. How does Random Forest Regressor reduce the risk of overfitting?\n",
    "\n",
    "A2. Random Forest Regressor reduces the risk of overfitting through the following mechanisms:\n",
    "\n",
    "Bootstrap Sampling: Each decision tree is trained on a bootstrapped sample (randomly selected with replacement) of the data. This introduces diversity in the training data for each tree.\n",
    "Feature Randomness: At each node of a decision tree, a random subset of features is considered for splitting. This reduces the tendency of trees to fit noise in the data.\n",
    "Averaging Predictions: When making predictions, the outputs of all the individual trees are averaged. This averaging helps to smooth out the variance and noise in individual tree predictions.\n",
    "Q3. How does Random Forest Regressor aggregate the predictions of multiple decision trees?\n",
    "\n",
    "A3. Random Forest Regressor aggregates predictions through averaging. When a new data point is presented to the ensemble for prediction, each individual decision tree produces its own prediction. The final prediction from the Random Forest is the average of the predictions produced by all the decision trees in the ensemble.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. What are the hyperparameters of Random Forest Regressor?\n",
    "A4. Some important hyperparameters of Random Forest Regressor include:\n",
    "\n",
    "n_estimators: Number of decision trees in the ensemble.\n",
    "max_depth: Maximum depth of each decision tree.\n",
    "min_samples_split: Minimum number of samples required to split an internal node.\n",
    "min_samples_leaf: Minimum number of samples required to be at a leaf node.\n",
    "max_features: Number of features to consider when looking for the best split.\n",
    "random_state: Seed for random number generation (to ensure reproducibility).\n",
    "Q5. What is the difference between Random Forest Regressor and Decision Tree Regressor?\n",
    "A5. The main difference is that Random Forest Regressor is an ensemble of multiple decision trees, whereas the Decision Tree Regressor is a single decision tree. Random Forest Regressor aggregates predictions from multiple trees to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting, while Decision Tree Regressor can easily overfit the data due to its single-tree nature.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6. What are the advantages and disadvantages of Random Forest Regressor?\n",
    "A6. Advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "Reduced overfitting through ensemble averaging.\n",
    "Robustness to outliers and noisy data.\n",
    "Handles nonlinear relationships effectively.\n",
    "Provides feature importance insights.\n",
    "Disadvantages:\n",
    "Complexity and computational resource requirements.\n",
    "Less interpretable than single decision trees.\n",
    "May not perform well on small datasets.\n",
    "Q7. What is the output of Random Forest Regressor?\n",
    "A7. The output of Random Forest Regressor is a continuous numeric value, which is the average of predictions from all the decision trees in the ensemble.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q8. Can Random Forest Regressor be used for classification tasks?\n",
    "A8. Yes, Random Forest Regressor can be used for classification tasks. However, it's more commonly associated with regression tasks. For classification tasks, the corresponding ensemble algorithm is called \"Random Forest Classifier.\""
