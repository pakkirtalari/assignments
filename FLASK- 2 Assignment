Q1. Explain GET and POST methods.

    The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is designed to enable communications between clients and servers.
    HTTP works as a request-response protocol between a client and server.
    
    The GET Method:-
      1. GET is used to request data from a specified resource.
      2. GET requests can be cached
      3. GET requests remain in the browser history
      4. GET requests can be bookmarked
      5. GET requests should never be used when dealing with sensitive data
      6. GET requests have length restrictions
      7. GET requests are only used to request data (not modify)
      
    The POST Method:-
      1. POST is used to send data to a server to create/update a resource.
      2. POST requests are never cached
      3. POST requests do not remain in the browser history
      4. POST requests cannot be bookmarked
      5. POST requests have no restrictions on data length
