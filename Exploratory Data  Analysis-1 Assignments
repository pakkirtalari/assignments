Q1. What are the key features of the wine quality data set? Discuss the importance of each feature in predicting the quality of wine.



Q2. How did you handle missing data in the wine quality data set during the feature engineering process?
Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of different imputation techniques.



Q3. What are the key factors that affect students' performance in exams? How would you go about
analyzing these factors using statistical techniques?



Q4. Describe the process of feature engineering in the context of the student performance data set. How
did you select and transform the variables for your model?



Q5. Load the wine quality data set and perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify the distribution
of each feature. Which feature(s) exhibit non-normality, and what transformations could be applied to
these features to improve normality?



Q6. Using the wine quality data set, perform principal component analysis (PCA) to reduce the number of
features. What is the minimum number of principal components required to explain 90% of the variance in
the data?
