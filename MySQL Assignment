Q1. What is a database? Differentiate between SQL and NoSQL databases.

  A database is an organized collection of structured information, or data, typically stored electronically in a computer system. A database is usually controlled by a database management system (DBMS)
  SQL databases are table-based, while NoSQL databases are document, key-value, graph, or wide-column stores. SQL databases are better for multi-row transactions, while NoSQL is better for unstructured data like documents or JSON.
  
Q2. What is DDL? Explain why CREATE, DROP, ALTER, and TRUNCATE are used with an example.

  Data Definition Language (DDL) is a subset of SQL. It is a language for describing data and its relationships in a database.
  Data definition language (DDL) statements let you to perform these tasks: Create, alter, and drop schema objects. Grant and revoke privileges and roles. Analyze information on a table, index, or cluster. Establish auditing options.
  
  1. CREATE TABLE
    The CREATE TABLE command creates a new table in the database.
    CREATE TABLE Persons (
        PersonID int,
        LastName varchar(255),
        FirstName varchar(255),
        Address varchar(255),
        City varchar(255)
    );
    
   2. DROP TABLE
    The DROP TABLE command deletes a table in the database.
    DROP TABLE Persons;
    
   3. ALTER TABLE
    The ALTER TABLE command adds, deletes, or modifies columns in a table.
    The ALTER TABLE command also adds and deletes various constraints in a table.
    ALTER TABLE Persons
    ADD Email varchar(255);
   
   4. TRUNCATE TABLE
    The TRUNCATE TABLE command deletes the data inside a table, but not the table itself.
    TRUNCATE TABLE Persons;
 
Q3. What is DML? Explain INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE with an example.

  Data manipulation language (DML) statements access and manipulate data in existing tables. In the SQL*Plus environment, you can enter a DML statement after the SQL> prompt. In the SQL Developer environment, you can enter a DML statement in the Worksheet.
  
  1. INSERT INTO
      The INSERT INTO command is used to insert new rows in a table.
      INSERT INTO Customers (CustomerName, ContactName, Address, City, PostalCode, Country)
      VALUES ('Cardinal', 'Tom B. Erichsen', 'Skagen 21', 'Stavanger', '4006', 'Norway');
  2. UPDATE
      The UPDATE statement is used to modify the existing records in a table.
      UPDATE table_name
      SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2, ...
      WHERE condition;
  3. DELETE
      The DELETE statement is used to delete existing records in a table.
      DELETE FROM table_name WHERE condition;
      
Q4. What is DQL? Explain SELECT with an example.



Q5. Explain Primary Key and Foreign Key.



Q6. Write a python code to connect MySQL to python. Explain the cursor() and execute() method.



Q7. Give the order of execution of SQL clauses in an SQL query.
