Q1. Explain the difference between simple linear regression and multiple linear regression. Provide an example of each.

    Simple Linear Regression: The association between two variables is established using a straight line in Simple Linear Regression. It tries to create a line that is as near to the data as possible by determining the slope and intercept, which define the line and reduce regression errors. There is a single x and y variable  
    Equation: Y = mX+c 

    Multiple Linear Regression: Multiple linear regressions are based on the presumption that both the dependent and independent variables, or Predictor and Target variables, have a linear relationship. There are two types of multilinear regressions: linear and nonlinear. It has one or more x variables and one or more y variables, or one dependent variable and two or more independent variables 
    Equation: Y = m1X1+m2X2+m3X3+..c 

    Where, 

    Y = Dependent Variable 
    m = Slope  
    X = Independent Variable 
    c = Intercept 
    
    For instance, when we predict rent based on square feet alone that is simple linear regression. 
    When we predict rent based on square feet and age of the building that is an example of multiple linear regression.
    
Q2. Discuss the assumptions of linear regression. How can you check whether these assumptions hold in a given dataset?

    There are primarily five assumptions of linear regression. They are:
    1. There is a linear relationship between the predictors (x) and the outcome (y) - We can check the linearity of the data by looking at the Residual vs Fitted plot. Ideally, this plot would not have a pattern where the red line (lowes smoother) is approximately horizontal at zero.
    2. Predictors (x) are independent and observed with negligible error - 
    3. Residual Errors have a mean value of zero
    4. Residual Errors have constant variance
    5. Residual Errors are independent from each other and predictors (x)

Q3. How do you interpret the slope and intercept in a linear regression model? Provide an example using a real-world scenario.



Q4. Explain the concept of gradient descent. How is it used in machine learning?



Q5. Describe the multiple linear regression model. How does it differ from simple linear regression?



Q6. Explain the concept of multicollinearity in multiple linear regression. How can you detect and
address this issue?



Q7. Describe the polynomial regression model. How is it different from linear regression?



Q8. What are the advantages and disadvantages of polynomial regression compared to linear
regression? In what situations would you prefer to use polynomial regression?
