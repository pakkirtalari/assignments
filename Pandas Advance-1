Q1. List any five functions of the pandas library with execution.




Q2. Given a Pandas DataFrame df with columns 'A', 'B', and 'C', write a Python function to re-index the
DataFrame with a new index that starts from 1 and increments by 2 for each row.




Q3. You have a Pandas DataFrame df with a column named 'Values'. Write a Python function that
iterates over the DataFrame and calculates the sum of the first three values in the 'Values' column. The
function should print the sum to the console.
For example, if the 'Values' column of df contains the values [10, 20, 30, 40, 50], your function should
calculate and print the sum of the first three values, which is 60.




Q4. Given a Pandas DataFrame df with a column 'Text', write a Python function to create a new column
'Word_Count' that contains the number of words in each row of the 'Text' column.




Q5. How are DataFrame.size() and DataFrame.shape() different?




Q6. Which function of pandas do we use to read an excel file?




Q7. You have a Pandas DataFrame df that contains a column named 'Email' that contains email
addresses in the format 'username@domain.com'. Write a Python function that creates a new column
'Username' in df that contains only the username part of each email address.
The username is the part of the email address that appears before the '@' symbol. For example, if the
email address is 'john.doe@example.com', the 'Username' column should contain 'john.doe'. Your
function should extract the username from each email address and store it in the new 'Username'
column.





Q8. You have a Pandas DataFrame df with columns 'A', 'B', and 'C'. Write a Python function that selects
all rows where the value in column 'A' is greater than 5 and the value in column 'B' is less than 10. The
function should return a new DataFrame that contains only the selected rows.
For example, if df contains the following values:
                                                    A B C
                                                  0 3 5 1
                                                  1 8 2 7
                                                  2 6 9 4
                                                  3 2 3 5
                                                  4 9 1 2
