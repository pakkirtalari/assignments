Q1. What is data encoding? How is it useful in data science?

    Encoding is a technique of converting categorical variables into numerical values so that it could be easily fitted to a machine learning model.
    Data encoding refers to the process of converting categorical or non-numerical data into numerical representations that can be used for analysis or modeling in data science. Categorical data represents variables with discrete values that do not have a natural numerical order or meaning, such as gender (male/female), color (red/blue/green), or country (USA/UK/Canada).
    Data encoding is useful in data science for several reasons:

    Numerical representation: Many machine learning algorithms and statistical techniques require numerical input. 
    By encoding categorical data into numerical form, we enable these algorithms to process and analyze the data effectively.

    Feature engineering: Data encoding is an essential step in feature engineering, which involves transforming raw data into informative features 
    that can improve the performance of machine learning models. By properly encoding categorical variables, 
    we can capture their information and incorporate it into the models.

    Handling non-numeric data: Data encoding allows us to handle non-numeric data types in a meaningful way. 
    It enables the inclusion of categorical variables in mathematical calculations and distance-based metrics.

    Increasing model interpretability: Encoding categorical data can help improve the interpretability of the models. 
    By representing categorical variables in numerical form, it becomes easier to understand their impact and relationships within the model.
    
Q2. What is nominal encoding? Provide an example of how you would use it in a real-world scenario.



Q3. In what situations is nominal encoding preferred over one-hot encoding? Provide a practical example



Q4. Suppose you have a dataset containing categorical data with 5 unique values. Which encoding
technique would you use to transform this data into a format suitable for machine learning algorithms?
Explain why you made this choice.



Q5. In a machine learning project, you have a dataset with 1000 rows and 5 columns. Two of the columns
are categorical, and the remaining three columns are numerical. If you were to use nominal encoding to
transform the categorical data, how many new columns would be created? Show your calculations.



Q6. You are working with a dataset containing information about different types of animals, including their
species, habitat, and diet. Which encoding technique would you use to transform the categorical data into
a format suitable for machine learning algorithms? Justify your answer.


Q7.You are working on a project that involves predicting customer churn for a telecommunications
company. You have a dataset with 5 features, including the customer's gender, age, contract type,
monthly charges, and tenure. Which encoding technique(s) would you use to transform the categorical
data into numerical data? Provide a step-by-step explanation of how you would implement the encoding.
