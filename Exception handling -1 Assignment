1. What is an Exception in python? Write the difference between Exceptions and syntax errors

Answer:-
  Errors and Exceptions in Python:-
    Errors are the problems in a program due to which the program will stop the execution. On the other hand, exceptions are raised when some internal events occur which changes the normal flow of the program. 
    Two types of Error occurs in python. 
      1. Syntax errors
      2. Logical errors (Exceptions) 
      Syntax errors:-
        When the proper syntax of the language is not followed then a syntax error is thrown.
        Example :- 
            amount = 25
            if(amount>18)
              print("You are eligible to vote")

            It returns a syntax error message because after the if statement a colon: is missing. We can fix this by writing the correct syntax.
      Logical errors(Exception)
          When in the runtime an error that occurs after passing the syntax test is called exception or logical type. 
          For example, when we divide any number by zero then the ZeroDivisionError exception is raised, or when we import a module that does not exist then ImportError is raised.
          Example:-
              marks = 10000
              a = marks / 0
              print(a)

              In the above example the ZeroDivisionError as we are trying to divide a number by 0.
