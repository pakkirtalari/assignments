Q1. Pearson correlation coefficient is a measure of the linear relationship between two variables. Suppose
you have collected data on the amount of time students spend studying for an exam and their final exam
scores. Calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient between these two variables and interpret the result.

  import pandas as pd
  df = pd.DataFrame({'time_spent':[5,8,6,9,10,4,2,10,8,7], 'scores':[35,76,53,81,95,28,16,94,78,62]})

  import numpy as np 
  df.corr(method='pearson')

  output = 0.99 (correlation coeffient between the time spent and scores they got)
  As the Pearson correlation coefficient is close to 1, it indicates a strong positive linear relationship. 
  This means that as the amount of time students spend studying increases, their final exam scores tend to increase as well.
  

Q2. Spearman's rank correlation is a measure of the monotonic relationship between two variables.
Suppose you have collected data on the amount of sleep individuals get each night and their overall job
satisfaction level on a scale of 1 to 10. Calculate the Spearman's rank correlation between these two
variables and interpret the result.

  import pandas as pd
  df = pd.DataFrame({'sleeping_hours':[5,8,6,4,6,4,5,7,8,7], 'satisfaction_level':[4,9,7,3,6,3,5,7,10,9]})

  import numpy as np 
  df.corr(method='spearman')
  
  As the Spearman's rank correlation coefficient is close to 1, it indicates a strong positive monotonic relationship. This means that as the amount of sleep individuals get each night increases, their overall job satisfaction tends to increase as well. 
  The ranks of the variables move in the same direction.
  
Q3. Suppose you are conducting a study to examine the relationship between the number of hours of
exercise per week and body mass index (BMI) in a sample of adults. You collected data on both variables
for 50 participants. Calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient and the Spearman's rank correlation
between these two variables and compare the results.

   df = pd.DataFrame({'no_hours' : [4.5, 7.2, 3.8, 5.1, 6.3, 2.9, 4.7, 6.5, 3.2, 5.8,4.5, 7.2, 3.8, 5.1, 6.3, 2.9, 4.7, 6.5, 3.2, 5.8,4.5, 7.2, 3.8, 5.1, 6.3, 2.9, 4.7, 6.5, 3.2, 5.8,4.5, 7.2, 3.8, 5.1, 6.3, 2.9, 4.7, 6.5, 3.2, 5.8,4.5, 7.2, 3.8, 5.1, 6.3, 2.9, 4.7, 6.5, 3.2, 5.8],
  'bmi' : [23.2, 25.1, 21.5, 24.9, 27.8, 20.3, 22.6, 26.5, 19.8,23.7,23.2, 25.1, 21.5, 24.9, 27.8, 20.3, 22.6, 26.5, 19.8,23.7,23.2, 25.1, 21.5, 24.9, 27.8, 20.3, 22.6, 26.5, 19.8,23.7,23.2, 25.1, 21.5, 24.9, 27.8, 20.3, 22.6, 26.5, 19.8,23.7,23.2, 25.1, 21.5, 24.9, 27.8, 20.3, 22.6, 26.5, 19.8,23.7]})
  import numpy as np 
  cor_sp = df.corr(method='spearman')
  cor_pear = df.corr(method='pearson')
  print(cor_sp)
  print(cor_pear)
  
  The Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.88 suggests a moderate positive linear relationship between the number of hours of exercise per week and BMI. 
  It indicates that as the number of hours of exercise per week increases, the BMI tends to increase, although the relationship is not extremely strong.
  
  The Spearman's rank correlation coefficient of 0.92 indicates a strong positive monotonic relationship between the number of hours of exercise per week and BMI. 
  It suggests that as the number of hours of exercise per week increases, the BMI tends to increase monotonically.
  
  In this case, both the Pearson correlation coefficient (r = 0.88) and the Spearman's rank correlation coefficient (œÅ = 0.92) suggest a positive relationship between the number of hours of exercise per week and BMI. 
  However, the Spearman's rank correlation coefficient captures the monotonic relationship more accurately and is less sensitive to outliers or non-linear relationships.

Q4. A researcher is interested in examining the relationship between the number of hours individuals
spend watching television per day and their level of physical activity. The researcher collected data on
both variables from a sample of 50 participants. Calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient between
these two variables.

  import pandas as pd
  df = pd.DataFrame({'TV_hours' : [3.5	, 2.8	, 4.2	,2.1	,3.9	,2.4	,3.1	,2.7	,3.8	,2.5], 'Physical_activity' : [2.7, 3.1, 2.5, 3.4, 2.9, 3.2, 3.0, 3.3, 2.6, 3.1]})
  import numpy as np
  df.corr('pearson')
  
  As pearson's correlation coeffient is close to -1, it indicates a strong negative linear relationship between the variables. As one variable increases, the other tends to decrease.


Q5. A survey was conducted to examine the relationship between age and preference for a particular
brand of soft drink. The survey results are shown below:

Age(Years) = [25 , 42, 37, 19, 31, 28]
Soft drink Preference = [Coke, Pepsi, Mountain dew, Coke, Pepsi, Coke]

  import pandas as pd
  df = pd.DataFrame({'Age_yrs' : [25 , 42, 37, 19, 31, 28], 'Soft_drink_Preference' : ['Coke', 'Pepsi', 'Mountain dew', 'Coke', 'Pepsi', 'Coke']})
  from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder
  encoder = LabelEncoder()
  encoded_df = encoder.fit_transform(df[['Soft_drink_Preference']])
  df['Soft_drink_Preference'] = encoded_df
  import numpy as np
  df.cov()

  or

  import pandas as pd
  Coke = 1
  Pepsi = 2
  Mountain_dew = 3
  df1 = pd.DataFrame({'Age_yrs' : [25 , 42, 37, 19, 31, 28], 'Soft_drink_Preference' : [1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1]})
  import numpy as np
  df1.cov()

   As the covariance is positive, it indicates that when one variable is above its mean, the other tends to be above its mean as well, and vice versa. It suggests a positive relationship between the variables.

Q6. A company is interested in examining the relationship between the number of sales calls made per day
and the number of sales made per week. The company collected data on both variables from a sample of
30 sales representatives. Calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient between these two variables.

  import pandas as pd
  df = pd.DataFrame({'sales_call_hours_per_day' : [10, 12	, 8	,11	,9	,10	,12	,11	,9	,13	], 'no_of_sales_per_week' : [5, 7, 4, 6, 5, 6, 8, 7, 5, 8]})
  import numpy as np
  df.corr('pearson')
