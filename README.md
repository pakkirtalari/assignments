ASSIGNMENT-29th January 2023
1. Python was created by Guido van Rossum, and first released on February 20, 1991. While you may know the python as a large snake, the name of the Python programming language comes from an old BBC television comedy sketch series called Monty Python's Flying Circus.
2. Python is a multi-paradigm programming language. Object-oriented programming and structured programming are fully supported, and many of their features support functional programming and aspect-oriented programming (including metaprogramming and metaobjects).
3. Python is a case-sensitive language, i.e., it treats uppercase and lowercase characters differently. This applies to identifiers too. You must avoid using the same name with different cases while naming identifiers. It is always good to use names that are more easily understood.
4. The correct extension of python is . py and can be written in any text editor. We need to use the extension . py to save these files.
5. Python is an interpreted language, which means the source code of a Python program is converted into bytecode that is then executed by the Python virtual machine. Python is different from major compiled languages, such as C and C + +, as Python code is not required to be built and linked like code for these languages.
6. age = 19
    if age > 18:
      print("Eligible to vote")
    else:
      print("Not eligible to vote")
7. Hash character(#) is used to comment the line in the Python program. Comments does not have to be text to explain the code, it can also be used to prevent Python from executing code.
8. python_version() method present in the platform module to print the version of the Python interpreter installed on the system. The platform. python_version() method returns a string in the form major.
9. Python supports to make anonymous functions which are not bound to a name(@ runtime). It uses a construct called "lambda" .
10. Pip is a package-management system written in Python and is used to install and manage software packages. The Python Software Foundation recommends using pip for installing Python applications and its dependencies during deployment.
11. Built-in Functions: range()	Returns a sequence of numbers, starting from 0 and increments by 1 (by default); frozenset()	Returns a frozenset object; slice()	Returns a slice object; str()	Returns a string object
12. An identifier can have a maximum length of 79 characters in Python. Python is one of the most popular programming languages.
13. 5 advantages of Python
a) Large developer community. Python is one of the most popular programming languages in the world.
b) Extensive libraries. Python offers a wide range of libraries that can be used across various applications.
c) Write less, do more. Python has very concise syntax. 
d) Portability.
e) Wide range of use cases.
14. Memory management in Python involves a private heap containing all Python objects and data structures. The management of this private heap is ensured internally by the Python memory manager.
15. The complete path of python.exe can be added by:
  Right-clicking This PC and going to Properties.
  Clicking on the Advanced system settings in the menu on the left.
  Clicking on the Environment Variables button o​n the bottom right.
  In the System variables section, selecting the Path variable and clicking on Edit. The next screen will show all the directories that are currently a part of the PATH variable.
  Clicking on New and entering Python’s install directory.
  Python can now be used directly from the command prompt without having to write its location. Try executing the command python --version; it will output the version  of Python installed on your system.
  16. Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line. Where in other programming languages the indentation in code is for readability only, the indentation in Python is very important. Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.
