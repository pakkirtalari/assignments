    In programming, loops are used to repeat a block of code. For example, if we want to show a message 100 times, then we can use a loop. Python while loop is used to run a block code until a certain condition is met.A while loop evaluates the condition. If the condition evaluates to True, the code inside the while loop is executed.
    condition is evaluated again. This process continues until the condition is False. When condition evaluates to False, the loop stops.
    ## program to display numbers from 1 to 5
    # initialize the variable
    i = 1
    n = 5
    # while loop from i = 1 to 5
    while i <= n:
        print(i)
        i = i + 1
    ## program to calculate the sum of numbers
    # until the user enters zero
    total = 0
    number = int(input('Enter a number: '))
    # add numbers until number is zero
    while number != 0:
        total += number    # total = total + number
        # take integer input again
        number = int(input('Enter a number: '))
    print('total =', total)
