Q1. Which keyword is used to create a function? Create a function to return a list of odd numbers in the
range of 1 to 25.?
    The word def is the keyword for defining a function. The function name is followed by parameter(s) in (). 
    The colon : signals the start of the function body, which is marked by indentation. 
    Inside the function body, the return statement determines the value to be returned.
    Problem:-
    def oddfn(a,b):
    newlist = []
    for i in range(a,b+1):
        if i % 2 != 0:
            newlist.append(i)
    return newlist
    oddfn(1,25) return [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25]



Q2. Why *args and **kwargs is used in some functions? Create a function each for *args and **kwargs to
demonstrate their use.
