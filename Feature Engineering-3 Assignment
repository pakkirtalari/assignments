Q1. What is Min-Max scaling, and how is it used in data preprocessing? Provide an example to illustrate its application.

    the minimum of feature is made equal to zero and the maximum of feature equal to one. MinMax Scaler shrinks the data within the given range, usually of 0 to 1. 
    It transforms data by scaling features to a given range.It scales the values to a specific value range without changing the shape of the original distribution.
        df1 = sns.load_dataset("planets")
        df1.head()
        from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler
        scaler = MinMaxScaler()
        scaler.fit_transform(df1[['mass', 'distance']])

Q2. What is the Unit Vector technique in feature scaling, and how does it differ from Min-Max scaling? Provide an example to illustrate its application.

    The Unit Vector technique, also known as normalization, is a feature scaling method that rescales the values of a feature into a range between 0 and 1. 
    It involves dividing each value of the feature by the maximum absolute value of that feature across the dataset.
    The Unit Vector technique ensures that all feature values are proportionally scaled based on their maximum absolute value. As a result, the data is transformed so that the maximum absolute value becomes 1, and all other values are scaled proportionally.
    On the other hand, Min-Max scaling is another popular feature scaling technique. It also rescales the feature values to a specific range, typically between 0 and 1. However, Min-Max scaling uses a different approach. 
    It subtracts the minimum value of the feature and then divides by the range (i.e., the difference between the maximum and minimum values) of that feature. 
    
    df = sns.load_dataset('taxis')
    from sklearn.preprocessing import normalize
    normalize(df[['distance','fare','tip']])
    

Q3. What is PCA (Principle Component Analysis), and how is it used in dimensionality reduction? Provide an example to illustrate its application.



Q4. What is the relationship between PCA and Feature Extraction, and how can PCA be used for Feature Extraction? Provide an example to illustrate this concept.
