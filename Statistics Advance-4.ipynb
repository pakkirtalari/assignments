    "Q1: What is the difference between a t-test and a z-test? Provide an example scenario where you would use each type of test.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main difference between a t-test and a z-test lies in the knowledge of population parameters. A z-test is used when the population standard deviation is known, while a t-test is used when the population standard deviation is unknown and must be estimated from the sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example Scenario:\n",
    "\n",
    "Z-test: You have the heights of a population and know its standard deviation. You want to test if the sample mean height is significantly different from the population mean height.\n",
    "T-test: You have a sample of exam scores from a group of students, and you want to test if their mean score is significantly different from a known population mean score.\n",
    "Q2: Differentiate between one-tailed and two-tailed tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a one-tailed test, the alternative hypothesis specifies a direction of the effect (e.g., greater than or less than). In a two-tailed test, the alternative hypothesis does not specify a direction and tests for any significant difference.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3: Explain the concept of Type 1 and Type 2 errors in hypothesis testing. Provide an example scenario for each type of error.\n",
    "\n",
    "Type 1 Error (False Positive): Rejecting a true null hypothesis. Example: A medical test falsely indicates a healthy person has a disease.\n",
    "Type 2 Error (False Negative): Failing to reject a false null hypothesis. Example: A medical test fails to detect a disease in a person who actually has it.\n",
    "Q4: Explain Bayes's theorem with an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bayes's Theorem is a mathematical formula that calculates the probability of an event based on prior knowledge of related events. It's often used in conditional probability calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: You want to know the probability that a person has a certain disease given that they tested positive. You know the probability of testing positive if you have the disease and the overall prevalence of the disease.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5: What is a confidence interval? How to calculate the confidence interval, explain with an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "A confidence interval is a range of values around a point estimate (e.g., a sample mean) within which the true population parameter is likely to fall with a certain level of confidence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: A survey finds the average income of a sample of 200 people is $50,000, and the standard deviation is $5,000. A 95% confidence interval for the true average income is calculated as $50,000 ± (1.96 * $5,000), resulting in a range of $40,800 to $59,200."

    "Problem: Suppose a medical test is used to detect a rare disease. The disease affects 1 in 1,000 people in the population. The test has a sensitivity of 95% (correctly identifies the disease when it's present) and a specificity of 90% (correctly identifies the absence of disease when it's not present). If a randomly selected person tests positive for the disease, what is the probability that they actually have the disease?\n",
