Q1, Create a vehicle class with an init method having instance variables as name_of_vehicle, max_speed
and average_of_vehicle.

      class vehicle:
    
          def __init__(self, name_of_vehicle, max_speed, average_of_vehicle):
              self.name_of_vehicle = name_of_vehicle
              self.max_speed = max_speed
              self.average_of_vehicle = average_of_vehicle
              print("My vehicle name", self.name_of_vehicle)
              print("vehicle speed is ", self.max_speed)
              print("average of the vehicle is", self.average_of_vehicle)
      obj_vehicle = vehicle("toyato", 180, 60)
      
      
Q2. Create a child class car from the vehicle class created in Que 1, which will inherit the vehicle class.
Create a method named seating_capacity which takes capacity as an argument and returns the name of
the vehicle and its seating capacity.
