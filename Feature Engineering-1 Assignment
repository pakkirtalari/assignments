Q1: What are missing values in a dataset? Why is it essential to handle missing values? Name some
algorithms that are not affected by missing values.

Missing data, or missing values, occur when you don't have data stored for certain variables or participants. 
Data can go missing due to incomplete data entry, equipment malfunctions, lost files, and many other reasons. 

It is important to handle missing values as they can lead to inaccurate conclusions about the data, which can significantly impact the accuracy of the analysis. 
There are several methods available to handle missing values, such as removal, imputation, flagging, etc.

All the machine learning algorithms donâ€™t support missing values but some ML algorithms are robust to missing values in the dataset. The k-NN algorithm can ignore a column from a distance measure when a value is missing. 
Naive Bayes can also support missing values when making a prediction. These algorithms can be used when the dataset contains null or missing values.

Q2: List down techniques used to handle missing data. Give an example of each with python code.



Q3: Explain the imbalanced data. What will happen if imbalanced data is not handled?



Q4: What are Up-sampling and Down-sampling? Explain with an example when up-sampling and down-
sampling are required.



Q5: What is data Augmentation? Explain SMOTE.



Q6: What are outliers in a dataset? Why is it essential to handle outliers?



Q7: You are working on a project that requires analyzing customer data. However, you notice that some of
the data is missing. What are some techniques you can use to handle the missing data in your analysis?



Q8: You are working with a large dataset and find that a small percentage of the data is missing. What are
some strategies you can use to determine if the missing data is missing at random or if there is a pattern
to the missing data?


Q9: Suppose you are working on a medical diagnosis project and find that the majority of patients in the
dataset do not have the condition of interest, while a small percentage do. What are some strategies you
can use to evaluate the performance of your machine learning model on this imbalanced dataset?



Q10: When attempting to estimate customer satisfaction for a project, you discover that the dataset is
unbalanced, with the bulk of customers reporting being satisfied. What methods can you employ to
balance the dataset and down-sample the majority class?



Q11: You discover that the dataset is unbalanced with a low percentage of occurrences while working on a
project that requires you to estimate the occurrence of a rare event. What methods can you employ to
balance the dataset and up-sample the minority class?
