Q1. What is the difference between Ordinal Encoding and Label Encoding? Provide an example of when you
might choose one over the other.



Q2. Explain how Target Guided Ordinal Encoding works and provide an example of when you might use it in
a machine learning project.



Q3. Define covariance and explain why it is important in statistical analysis. How is covariance calculated?



Q4. For a dataset with the following categorical variables: Color (red, green, blue), Size (small, medium,
large), and Material (wood, metal, plastic), perform label encoding using Python's scikit-learn library.
Show your code and explain the output.



Q5. Calculate the covariance matrix for the following variables in a dataset: Age, Income, and Education
level. Interpret the results.



Q6. You are working on a machine learning project with a dataset containing several categorical
variables, including "Gender" (Male/Female), "Education Level" (High School/Bachelor's/Master's/PhD),
and "Employment Status" (Unemployed/Part-Time/Full-Time). Which encoding method would you use for
each variable, and why?




Q7. You are analyzing a dataset with two continuous variables, "Temperature" and "Humidity", and two
categorical variables, "Weather Condition" (Sunny/Cloudy/Rainy) and "Wind Direction" (North/South/
East/West). Calculate the covariance between each pair of variables and interpret the results.
